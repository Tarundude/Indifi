Business expansion often necessitates financial support, and small businesses in India frequently turn to banks and NBFCs for assistance. Two common types of loans are secured and unsecured loans. Secured loans require collateral and offer lower interest rates, while unsecured loans do not require collateral but come with higher interest rates and smaller repayment tenures.
Secured loans are typically obtained from banks, credit unions, or online lenders and offer lower interest rates due to collateral. Unsecured loans, on the other hand, rely solely on the borrower's creditworthiness and are available from online lenders, often with higher interest rates.
Reasons for opting for unsecured loans include avoiding hefty collaterals and meeting minimal loan criteria. These loans are available from banks and NBFCs, with eligibility criteria based on age, business performance, existence, and credit score.
Features of unsecured loans include collateral-free nature, flexible application processes, quick approvals, and transparent terms with no hidden charges.
In conclusion, while unsecured loans may carry higher interest rates, they remain crucial for small business expansion in India, providing vital financial support without the need for collateral.
